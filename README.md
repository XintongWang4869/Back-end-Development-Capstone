# A Band Website using Django

This project is to build a website for a band. 

This is the main Django application that connects to two microservices built with Flask: a [song management service](https://github.com/XintongWang4869/Back-End-Development-Songs) that supports CRUD operations with MongoDB, and a [picture service](https://github.com/XintongWang4869/Back-End-Development-Pictures) that provides RESTul APIs.

This main application includes a Concert data model and utilizes the built-in User model, which can create tables and relationships with the Django migration tool. There are also controllers to implement business logic to send the appropriate data to the provided templates.

## Demo

Users will be able to perform the following actions on the site:

Anonymous use cases:
* The user visits the Django Website home page.
* The Song page shows songs and lyrics.
* The Picture page shows pictures from past concerts.
* The user can sign into the application.

Signed in use cases:
* The user can see their concerts.
* The user can book a concert.
* The user can delete their reservation.
  
Admin use cases:
* Admin can change the concert date.

## Lab

**Environment Setup**

```
bash ./bin/setup.sh
exit
```

### Complete the Data Model Classes

Add properties with desired attributes to each model in "models.py"

To propagate the changes made to the models:    
* `python manage.py makemigrations`   
* `python manage.py migrate`

Check if you are ready to launch the application: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8000`   
* -s: silent mode, meaning it wonâ€™t show progress or error messages.
* -o /dev/null: to discard the output by sending it to /dev/null, which is a special file that discards all data written to it.
* -w "%{http_code}": specifies a custom output format. 

### Fix Each Page 

1. Complete the URL in "urls.py"

> Django: Often uses **trailing slashes** in URL patterns to avoid unnecessary redirects.   
> * Additional tips on re_path():      
>   ```
>      urlpatterns = [
>       re_path(r'^birthday/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month>[0-9]{2})/(?P<day>[0-9]{2})/$', views.birthday_view),
>   ]
>   ``` 
> Flask: Does not require trailing slashes by default, but you can handle both versions explicitly.

2. Complete the view in "views.py"  

You can first use simple dictionary data to test functionality, which will be eventually replaced by the deployed microservice URL.

### Admin

Superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

## Deploy on IBM Kubernetes Services

1. Setup the environment
2. Replace with deployed microservice URLs.
3. Make migrations
4. Check if the app can run locally: `python3 manage.py runserver`
5. Create a Dockerfile
6. Build and push the image
7. Create a deployment.yml
8. `kubectl apply -f ./deployment.yml`  
> Watch the pods: `kubectl get pods -w`

9. Access the deployment from outside the cluster: `kubectl port-forward po/pod_id 8000:8000`
