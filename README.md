**Environment Setup**

```
bash ./bin/setup.sh
exit
```

## Django application

### Complete the Data Model Classes

Add properites with desired attributes to each model in "models.py"

To propagate the changes made to the models:    
* `python manage.py makemigrations`   
* `python manage.py migrate`

Check if you are ready to launch the application: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8000`   
* -s: silent mode, meaning it wonâ€™t show progress or error messages.
* -o /dev/null: to discard the output by sending it to /dev/null, which is a special file that discards all data written to it.
* -w "%{http_code}": specifies a custom output format. 

### Fix Each Page 

1. Complete the URL in "urls.py"

> Django: Often uses **trailing slashes** in URL patterns to avoid unnecessary redirects.   
> * re_path():      
```
   urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^birthday/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month>[0-9]{2})/(?P<day>[0-9]{2})/$', views.birthday_view),
]
``` 
> Flask: Does not require trailing slashes by default, but you can handle both versions explicitly.

2. Complete the view in `views.py`  

You can first use simple dictionary data to test functionality, which will be eventually replaced by deployed microservice url.

### Admin

Superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

## Deploy on IBM Kubernetes Services

1. Setup the environment
2. Replace with deployed microservice URLs.
3. Make migrations
4. Check if the app can run locally: `python3 manage.py runserver`
5. Create a Dockerfile
6. Build and push the image
7. Create a deployment.yml
8. `kubectl apply -f ./deployment.yml`  
> Watch the pods: `kubectl get pods -w`

9. Access the deployment from outside the cluster: `kubectl port-forward po/pod_id 8000:8000`
